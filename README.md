# Mia Platform Fastify Plugin

Unofficial name: `fastify/mia-hot-start`

## Who am I?

Everything that cpl + lc39 gives you, plus:

- Plugin like idiomatic Fastify

- Zero required variables for the plugin, can run on your PC without an env setup

- You'll create your Fastify instance, so give it whatever initial config you want

- Composable, not generalized

- Module, not wrapper

- Default types, nothing custom

- You can turn off everything if you don't want it or want to implement it in another way

- Run it like "node index.js", this is useful for tools like `clinicjs doctor` that need a node process and, of course, for code clarity

- Easy typescript integration

- Fastify type providers ready <-- probably the biggest thing

- Easily testable, following the Fastify guidelines

- Low impact on the code: without custom options it's a 4 line function to fire and forget
